# FINDING FILES

## Data Structures
    To implement this I used a Queue.
    
## Time complexity
    I visit each file exactly once, so the time complexity is O(n),
    where n is the number of files and folders.

## Space complexity
     I'm using a Queue to keep track of the current level of files,
     this is a space complexity of O(n) where n is the number
     of files and folders.
