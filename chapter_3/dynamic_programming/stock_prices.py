"""
You are given access to yesterday's stock prices for a single stock. The data is in the form of an array with the stock
price in 30 minute intervals from 9:30 a.m EST opening to 4:00 p.m EST closing time. With this data, write a function
that returns the maximum profit obtainable. You will need to buy before you can sell.

For example, suppose you have the following prices:

prices = [3, 4, 7, 8, 6]

    Note: This is a shortened array, just for the sake of exampleâ€”a full set of prices for the day would have 13
    elements (one price for each 30 minute interval betwen 9:30 and 4:00), as seen in the test cases further down in
    this notebook.

In order to get the maximum profit in this example, you would want to buy at a price of 3 and sell at a price of 8 to
yield a maximum profit of 5. In other words, you are looking for the greatest possible difference between two numbers
in the array.
