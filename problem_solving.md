### What is the first thing we should do to solve a problem like this one?
    Make sure we understand the problem

###What does it mean to understand a computational problem?
    0. Don't panic!
    1. Understand what the possible inputs are.
        What are the inputs?
            Defensive Programming for inputs.
                Use assertions to fail if the original conditions 
                weren't satisfied

        How are the inputs represented?
    2. Understand what the possible outputs are.
    3. Solve the problem! 
        Work out some examples to better understand the relashionship 
        between the inputs and the outputs.
        Consider systematically how a human solves the problem.
    4. Write an algorithm in pseudocode.
    5. Don't optimise prematurely.
        Simple and correct.
    6. Write small bits of code and test them.
    7. Understand what they do.
    
    
###My notes:
    To reduce time complexity:
        - allocate a new data structure
        - work with partial results
        - work with the properties of the inputs
